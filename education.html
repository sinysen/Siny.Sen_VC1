          <h1>Education</h1>
          <p>Education in High school is the same to secondary school, you only study hard and and never think anything and nearly hometown, and have freetime.</p>
          <p>Education in University is too deference from high school like you need to live by your own self, living so far from hometown no freetime to visit anywhere. In university you need to study hard since second year and you need to find a job during studying to support your study and your rental house, and cooking food themself.</p>
          <p>But for PNC just study hard and full time, because the school have given money for student every month to buy food but for rental house is free for student.</p>
